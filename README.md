## FAQ


### What's the implementation of placeholders and interpolation?

A resource can return outputs. A map of key-values. There is no difference in format between plaintext and secrets, however any secrets are output using a MAGIC (ðŸª„) wrapping mechanism: `"LQNYUJB" encoded(<secret-name>/<key-name>) "BJUYNQL"`. When the final manifests are generated, these are converted into secret references or failures are generated.

The source of the secrets names and keys are from either pre-existing secrets that are assumed to exist, secret manifests generated by resources, or in some cases secrets that are inserted to the destination cluster by the provisioners.
